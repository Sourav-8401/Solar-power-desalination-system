            <h3>potable water from saline water </h3>
            <p>A solar-powered desalination unit produces potable water from saline water through direct or indirect
                methods of desalination powered by sunlight. Solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source
                due to its ability to drive the more popular thermal desalination systems directly through solar
                collectors and to drive physical and chemical desalination systems indirectly through photovoltaic
                cells.Direct solar desalination produces distillate directly in the solar collector.
                An example would be a solar still which traps the Sun's energy to obtain freshwater through the process
                of evaporation and condensation. Indirect solar desalination incorporates solar energy collection
                systems with conventional desalination systems such as multi-stage flash distillation, multiple effect
                evaporation, freeze separation or reverse osmosis to produce freshwater.[2 </p>

            <p >While the intermittent nature of sunlight and its variable intensity throughout the day makes
                desalination during nighttime challenging, several energy storage options can be used to permit 24 hour
                operation. Batteries can store solar energy for use at night. Thermal energy storage systems ensure
                constant performance at night or on cloudy days, improving overall efficiency.[8] Alternatively, stored
                gravitational energy can be harnessed to provide energy to a solar-powered reverse osmosis unit during
                non-sunlight hours.</p>

                Senegalese community Ourong has a groundwater table is polluted with salted water. We decided to use the
                location of the village to our advantage by proposing the implementation of a desalination plant. We
                were searching for a solution that can provide affordable fresh water by using solar energy. Elemental

                Today more than 600 villagers benefit from this project. The engineers who made their way on-site to the

                <h3>The problem: expensive unsafe water</h3>
                The community relies on water that is trucked in on a daily basis. The results are a questionable
                quality upon
                delivery and a high water tariff of 6 $/m³. Lacking an alternative, the people are forced to spend a
                majority of
                their limited income on water, without the assurance of good quality and sufficient availability.

                <h3> The solution: solar energy desalination</h3>
                This changes completely when a decentralized solution by Elemental Water Makers is put in place: The
                Elemental
                Water Source™, which can be operated to produce 5 m³/day off-grid using only solar energy. There is also
                the
                option to produce 11 m³/day in hybrid mode making use of grid or generator power during the night. The
                Elemental
                Water Source™ allows the people to enjoy savings of 75% on water expenses and and total savings of over
                $300.000. The solution’s payback depends on several factors, but, on average, it is around 2.5 years.

                <h3>The benefits: savings & development</h3>
                The community now has high-quality potable water on-site, without the dependency of water trucking and
                associated carbon emissions, saving 10 tons of CO2 per year. The Source™ leads to empowerment, jobs and
                possibilities for education.

        <p class="s_efficient">A vision of development by entrepreneurship.</p>

        <div class="ele_para">One type of solar desalination unit is a solar still, it is also similar to a condensation
            trap. A solar still is a simple way of distilling water, using the heat of the Sun to drive evaporation from
            humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit
            stills. In a pit still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight
            shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips
            down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The
            basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way
            nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water
            vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts
            and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest
            rainwater.</div>

        <p class="efficient">Solar-powered reverse osmosis</p><br>

        <div class="ele_para">Osmosis is a natural phenomenon in which water passes through a membrane from a lower to a
            higher concentration solution. The flow of water can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic
            pressure is applied on the higher concentration side. In Reverse osmosis desalination systems, seawater
            pressure is raised above the natural osmotic pressure, forcing pure water through membrane pores to the
            fresh water side. Reverse osmosis (RO) is the most common desalination process in terms of installed
            capacity due to its superior energy efficiency compared to thermal desalination systems, despite requiring
            extensive water pre-treatment. Furthermore, part of the consumed mechanical energy can be reclaimed from the
            concentrated brine effluent with an energy recovery device. <br> <br>

            Solar-powered RO desalination is common in demonstration plants due to the modularity and scalability of
            both photovoltaic (PV) and RO systems. A detailed economic analysis [3] and a thorough optimisation strategy
            [4] of PV powered RO desalination were carried out with favorable results reported. Economic and reliability
            considerations are the main challenges to improving PV powered RO desalination systems. However, the quickly
            dropping PV panel costs are making solar-powered desalination ever more feasible. <br> <br>

            A solar powered desalination unit designed for remote communities has been tested in the Northern Territory
            of Australia. The "reverse-osmosis solar installation" (ROSI) uses membrane filtration to provide a reliable
            and clean drinking water stream from sources such as brackish groundwater. Solar energy overcomes the
            usually high-energy operating costs as well as greenhouse emissions of conventional reverse osmosis systems.
            ROSI can also remove trace contaminants such as arsenic and uranium that may cause certain health problems,
            and minerals such as calcium carbonate which causes water hardness. <br> <br>

            Project leader Dr Andrea Schaefer from the University of Wollongong's Faculty of Engineering said ROSI has
            the potential to bring clean water to remote communities throughout Australia that do not have access to a
            town water supply and/or the electricity grid. <br>

            Groundwater (which may contain dissolved salts or other contaminants) or surface water (which may have high
            turbidity or contain microorganisms) is pumped into a tank with an ultrafiltration membrane, which removes
            viruses and bacteria. This water is fit for cleaning and bathing. Ten percent of that water undergoes
            nanofiltration and reverse osmosis in the second stage of purification, which removes salts and trace
            contaminants, producing drinking water. A photovoltaic solar array tracks the Sun and powers the pumps
            needed to process the water, using the plentiful sunlight available in remote regions of Australia not
            served by the power grid.</div> <br><br>
